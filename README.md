This repository has the following files: `clean_data.r`,`clean_data.csv`,`Cerrado_edge_2019.r`,  and `cerrado_dados.xlsx.r`.

### clean_data.r

Based on `cerrado_dados.xlsx`, we edited (clean) the data in this script.

### clean_data.csv

The result of `clean_data.r`. It has the following columns:

`Plot`: plot id (25 m2).	

`trees_BA`: sum of tree stand basal area per plot.	

`trees_ab`: stem abundance of trees per plot.	

`lianas_BA`: sum of liana stand basal area per plot.	

`lianas_ab`: stem abundance of lianas per plot.		

`geo`: If the plot is located in the `south` or `east`.	

`dist`: If the plot is located in the `edge` or `interior`.		

`Tree_cov`: Tree cover, calculated by hemispheric photos.	

`Regen`: % of soil covered by regerative stratum.	

`Palm_cov`% of soil covered by Palms stratum.		

`Bare_soil`: % of soil covered by bare soil stratum.	

`native`: % of soil covered by native grass stratum.	

`exotic`: % of soil covered by exotic grass stratum.	

`brom`:% of soil covered by bromeliad stratum.		

`PAR`: Photosynthetically active radiation.

`SOM`: Soil Organic Matter.	

`Al`: Alumnium concentration in the soil.	

`Mn`: Manganese concentration in the soil.

`local`: Concatenate `geo` and `dist` variables.

### Cerrado_edge_2019.r
All the analyses performed and graphs constructed in a R script.

## cerrado_dados.xlsx
This spreadsheet has five sheets:
